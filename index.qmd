# Welcome!

Welcome to my econometrics lab.

This is a portfolio of my work in econometrics. The site will be updated as I continue to learn and grow in the field of econometrics. As of now, the site contains the following sections:

-   **Old school econometrics**:

     Simple linear regression\
     Survival analysis\
     Selection correction\

-   **Modern econometrics** (causal inference):

     Difference-in-difference\
     Regression Discontiunity\
     Instrumental variable\
     Synthetic control\

-   **Machine learning**\

     Regularisation (Ridge, lasso)\
     Tree-based methods (e.g. Random forest)\
     Support vector machine\

Enjoy!

This is the lab manual for the Fay Lab at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School for Marine Science and Technology.\
The focus of our work centers around developing interdisciplinary modeling approaches to extend the scope of applications for fisheries and ecosystem-based management. More about our group's research activity can be found on our [website](https://thefaylab.com).

This lab manual resource is intended to provide an overview for lab members and others about how we do our work, and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and for important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Gavin (gfay\@umassd.edu) or make a pull request.
