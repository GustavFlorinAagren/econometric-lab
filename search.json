    "text": "2.3 Predict per capita crime rate using best subset selection\nWe will now try to predict the per capita crime rate using best subset selection. We will first split the data into a training set and a test set. We will then fit a separate least squares regression to the training set for each possible combination of the 13 predictors. Then, we will use the regsubsets() function from the leaps library to perform best subset selection.\nBecause there is no predict() method for regsubsets() we have to create the same function ourselves. This function takes in the regsubsets object and the data set, and returns the predictions for the best model.\n\n predict.regsubsets &lt;- function(object, \n                                newdata, \n                                id, ...) {\n  form &lt;- as.formula(object$call[[2]])\n  mat &lt;- model.matrix(form, newdata)\n  coefi &lt;- coef(object, id = id)\n  xvars &lt;- names(coefi)\n  mat[, xvars] %*% coefi\n }\n\nNext, we will try to choose among the models of different sizes using cross-validation. This approach is somewhat involved, as we must perform best subset selection within each of the \\(k\\) training sets.\nFirst, we create a vector that allocates each observation to one of \\(k=10\\) folds, and create a matrix in which we will store the results.\n\nk &lt;- 10\nn &lt;- nrow(Boston)\nset.seed(1)\nfolds &lt;- sample(rep(1:k, length = n))\ncv.errors &lt;- matrix(NA, k, 12,\n    dimnames = list(NULL, paste(1:12)))\n\nNow we use a for loop to perform cross-validation. In the \\(j\\)th fold, the elements of folds that equal j are in the test set, and the remainder are in the training set. We make our predictions for each model size (using our new predict() method), compute the test errors on the appropriate subset, and store them in the appropriate slot in the matrix cv.errors.\n\nfor (j in 1:k) {\n  best.fit &lt;- regsubsets(crim ~ .,\n       data = Boston[folds != j, ],\n       nvmax = 12)\n  for (i in 1:12) {\n    pred &lt;- predict(best.fit, Boston[folds == j, ], id = i)\n    cv.errors[j, i] &lt;-\n         mean((Boston$crim[folds == j] - pred)^2)\n   }\n }\n\nThis has given us a \\(10 \\times 12\\) matrix, of which the \\((j,i)\\)th element corresponds to the test MSE for the \\(j\\)th cross-validation fold for the best \\(i\\)-variable model. I use the apply() function to average over the columns of this matrix in order to obtain a vector for which the \\(i\\)th element is the cross-validation error for the \\(i\\)-variable model.\n\nmean.cv.errors &lt;- apply(cv.errors, 2, mean)\nmean.cv.errors\n\n       1        2        3        4        5        6        7        8 \n46.00617 44.22854 44.41638 43.05242 43.47254 43.27042 43.01362 42.91980 \n       9       10       11       12 \n42.75855 42.75734 42.67672 42.71781 \n\nwhich.min(mean.cv.errors)\n\n11 \n11 \n\nmin(mean.cv.errors)\n\n[1] 42.67672\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))\nplot(mean.cv.errors, \n     type = \"b\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a data frame\ndata_df &lt;- data.frame(index = 1:length(mean.cv.errors), \n                      value = mean.cv.errors)\n\n# Index to highlight\nhighlight_index &lt;- which.min(mean.cv.errors)\n\n# Set specific breaks on the x-axis\ncustom_breaks &lt;- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)\n\n# Plot the data\ncv.plot &lt;- ggplot(data_df, \n       aes(x = index, \n           y = value)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_npg() +\n  theme_bw() + \n  geom_point(data = data.frame(index = highlight_index, value = data_df$value[highlight_index]),\n             aes(x = index, \n                 y = value), \n             color = \"red\", \n             shape = 19, \n             size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Predictors\", \n       y = \"Mean CV Errors\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = custom_breaks) +  # Set custom breaks on the x-axis\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12))\n\ncv.plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggsave(\"/Users/gustavaagren/Documents/Statistik/Statistisk inlärning/Assignment/cv.pdf\",\n       dpi = 100, \n       width = 18, \n       height = 12, \n       units = \"cm\")\n\nWe see that cross-validation selects a 11-variable model.

For the 70-74 age group the hazard is 1.2 times higher. For 75-79 age group the hazard is 1.75 times higher. For the oldest group (80+) the hazard is almost 3 times higher.

The hazard ratio for patients with stage T1c and T2 cancer is lower than for those with stage T1ab cancer.\nWe can also take a look at the partial residuals plot of each of the covariates in the model. The partial residuals plot shows the effect of each covariate on the survival function while adjusting for the other covariates in the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Partial residuals plot 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Partial residuals plot 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Partial residuals plot 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Cox proportional hazards model assumptions\nNext step in our analysis is to assess the validity of the model by using diagnostic plots in order to understand whether the underlying assumptions needed for this model are met. It is also a way to understand whether this model is appropriate for our data at hand. One of the assumption of a Cox proportional hazards regression model is that the hazards are proportional at each point in time throughout follow-up and this is what we will try to investigate.\nFirst we look at the log(-log(survival)) plot to check for deviations from the proportional hazards assumption in the first Cox model we made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Deviations from the proportional hazards assumption (sex)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6 shows that the lines are fairly but not perfectly parallel. This indicates that the proportional hazards assumption may hold for age group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Deviations from the proportional hazards assumption (sex)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7 shows that the lines are parallel all the time. This indicates that the proportional hazards assumption may hold for age group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Deviations from the proportional hazards assumption (sex)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8 shows that the lines are fairly but not perfectly parallel. This indicates that the proportional hazards assumption may hold for age group.\nWe now do a hypothesis test of whether the effect of each covariate differs according to time, and a global test of all covariates at once. This is done by testing for an interaction effect between the covariate and log(time). A significant p-value indicates that the proportional hazards assumption is violated. This is presented in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchoenfeld test for proportional hazards assumption\n\n\nvariable\nchisq\ndf\np.value\n\n\n\n\nageGroup\n8.900394\n3\n0.0306449435\n\n\ngrade\n3.639644\n1\n0.0564189807\n\n\nstage\n10.383688\n2\n0.0055617419\n\n\nGLOBAL\n25.536440\n6\n0.0002715458\n\n\n\n\n\nTest of proportional hazard assumption\n\n\nFrom the test we can see that age group has a p-value &lt; 0.05 which indicates that the proportional hazards assumption may be violated. For grade the null of no violation of the proportional hazards assumption cannot be rejected. Stage has a p-value &lt; 0.05 which indicates that the proportional hazards assumption may be violated. The global test for all covariates also has a p-value &lt; 0.05 which indicates that the proportional hazards assumption is violated and that the null of no violation of the proportional hazards assumption should be rejected.\nTo investigate further we want to look at the plots visualizing the scaled Schoenfeld residuals over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: Schoenfeld residuals over time (age group)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlots of the Schoenfeld residuals Deviation from a zero-slope line is evidence that the proportional hazards assumption is violated. One should note though that the violation of the proportionality assumption doesn’t necessarily mean the model is invalid since the violation might only be present for some subset of the population. In Figure 4.9 we see that the line is not straight (it looks as if it has a polynomial shape) which implies non-proportionality in the form of a rising hazard ratio over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Schoenfeld residuals over time (grade)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4.10 the line is not straight implying non-proportionality in the form of a declining hazard ratio over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: Schoenfeld residuals over time (stage)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 4.11 the line is not perfectly straight but close to although it has a somewhat declining hazard ratio over time.",

This begins by setting up a transition matrix.\n\n\n            to\nfrom         event-free prostate other\n  event-free         NA        1     2\n  prostate           NA       NA    NA\n  other              NA       NA    NA\n\n\nUsing the function msprep we can create a new data set that is suitable for competing risk analysis. This new data set, its 10 first rows seen in the table below, has twice as many rows as the original data. The first column, id, refering to the patient number is repeated twice. The column trans indicates the cause of death; “1” refers to death from prostate cancer and “2” refers to death from other causes. The column time is the time to the event or censoring, and the column status indicates whether the event was observed or censored. The columns grade, ageGroup, and stage are repeated for each cause of death. .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst ten rows of the new data\n\n\nid\nfrom\nto\ntrans\nTstart\nTstop\ntime\nstatus\ngrade\nageGroup\nstage\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n2\n1\n0\n18\n18\n0\nmode\n80+\nT1c\n\n\n1\n1\n3\n2\n0\n18\n18\n0\nmode\n80+\nT1c\n\n\n2\n1\n2\n1\n0\n23\n23\n0\nmode\n75-79\nT1ab\n\n\n2\n1\n3\n2\n0\n23\n23\n0\nmode\n75-79\nT1ab\n\n\n3\n1\n2\n1\n0\n37\n37\n0\npoor\n75-79\nT1c\n\n\n3\n1\n3\n2\n0\n37\n37\n0\npoor\n75-79\nT1c\n\n\n4\n1\n2\n1\n0\n27\n27\n0\nmode\n70-74\nT2\n\n\n4\n1\n3\n2\n0\n27\n27\n0\nmode\n70-74\nT2\n\n\n5\n1\n2\n1\n0\n42\n42\n0\nmode\n70-74\nT1c\n\n\n5\n1\n3\n2\n0\n42\n42\n0\nmode\n70-74\nT1c\n\n\n\nThe dataset set contains 28588 rows, twice as many as the original data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will now be able to look at the hazard of death from prostate cancer while treating the other causes as censored and vice versa.

The hazard of death from prostate cancer increases for patients with a poor grade.\nNow, let’s look at the effect of grade, age group, and stage on the hazard of death from other causes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompeting risk analysis 2, prostate cancer treated as censored\n\n\nVariable\nCoefficient\nexp.coef.\nStd..Error\nP.Value\n\n\n\n\ngradepoor\n0.187\n1.206\n0.041\n0.000\n\n\nageGroup70-74\n0.204\n1.226\n0.084\n0.015\n\n\nageGroup75-79\n0.501\n1.651\n0.079\n0.000\n\n\nageGroup80+\n0.993\n2.699\n0.076\n0.000\n\n\nstageT1c\n-0.485\n0.615\n0.046\n0.000\n\n\nstageT2\n-0.220\n0.802\n0.042\n0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this table, we see the estimates of the effect of grade, age group, and stage on the hazard of death from other causes. The hazard of death from other causes increases for patients with a poor grade but the exp coef is much smaller than that of prostate cancer. The question is then, is there a difference in this effect? Let’s test this using Putter et al.’s method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompeting risk analysis 3, using Putter et al.'s method\n\n\nVariable\nCoefficient\nexp.coef.\nStd..Error\nP.Value\n\n\n\n\ngradepoor\n2.748\n15.616\n0.148\n0.00\n\n\ntrans\nNA\nNA\n0.000\nNA\n\n\nageGroup70-74\n0.199\n1.220\n0.078\n0.01\n\n\nageGroup75-79\n0.555\n1.742\n0.072\n0.00\n\n\nageGroup80+\n1.028\n2.795\n0.070\n0.00\n\n\nstageT1c\n-0.452\n0.636\n0.042\n0.00\n\n\nstageT2\n-0.156\n0.856\n0.037\n0.00\n\n\ngradepoor:trans\n-1.285\n0.277\n0.082\n0.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last table shows the estimates of the competing risk analysis using Putter et al.’s method. Of main interest is to look at the interaction between grade poor and trans. This interaction term estimates the difference between the effect on prostate cancer death and death from other causes. The estimate is highly significant and represents the additional effect poor grade has on the risk of death from other causes relative to its effect on the risk of prostate cancer death. The hazard of death fro other causes is is 0.27 times the hazard of death from prostate cancer.\nTo conclude, this analysis has shown that a poor grade of prostate cancer strongly affects the risk of dying from prostate cancer. This effect is also much stronger on the risk of dying from prostate cancer than from other causes. The analysis also shows that the risk of dying from other causes is higher for older patients and for patients with more advanced stages of prostate cancer.",

    "text": "We approach our science with a common denominator of kindness. As part of our core lab culture, we:\n\nAsk for help, and share our learning\nMake ourselves available\nCome prepared and engage\nCelebrate accomplishments (ours & those of others)\nSustain a positive, safe learning environment\nHave an interdisciplinary (open) mindset\nAre mindful of our own biases\nPlan with intention, and follow through\nFoster inclusivity within our group and greater community\nPromote and sustain healthy work-life integration\nPractice radical candor\nAcknowledge and give credit to other lab member’s work\n\nThough we do not expect incoming members to memorize everything, we do expect members to be aware of the group’s values.\nAsk for help, and share your learning: We are all learners, and most of our learning is done from each other. It is inefficient to struggle through problems alone. Ask for and give assistance with appropriate cognizance of the value of your time and the time of the person you are asking. You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. When you identify a problem add an issue to the lab issues repository, and update it with solutions when it is resolved. Also consider writing a tutorial/blog post for inclusion in our lab’s shared resources, and share with the larger community by tweeting, leading and sharing at a lab meeting, or running a workshop (Quantfish woRkshop group, SouthCoast useR group, etc).\nMake yourself available: Be responsive to communication, and make time for things that address longer term goals, even when busy. For example, do not skip on things like attending seminars just because you have a big deadline looming (see note below on planning and organization). Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Because as a group we value the role of collaboration and interaction in improving our work, it is expected that you be available in the lab/office during normal business hours for some time during the week (see section on attendance expectations).\nCome prepared and be engaged: Value your time. Be present during lab and individual meetings, and come to your work ready to do your work. Contribute and participate in planning and lab discussions. When it is your turn to run a meeting, come with an agenda and be prepared with questions. Aim to view meetings as events that contribute to your work and productivity, rather than taking away from them.\nCelebrate accomplishments (yours & others): You and your colleagues work hard. Things don’t always go exactly as you plan. Be supportive and proud of yourself and your peers when you accomplish things. We are not competing with each other - someone else’s success does not mean your failure. Share your accomplishments with others!\nSustain a positive, safe learning environment: Everyone learns something for the first time at some time, and people learn in different ways. Expressing that you don’t know something is OK, and we understand that this can make someone feel vulnerable. We strive to maintain a culture that allows for and encourages this vulnerability. Community members should not be disparaged for not knowing things, and in addition, should not be disparaged for knowing things or wanting to learn.\nHave an interdisciplinary (open) mindset: We apply our work at the science-policy interface. This means we work on problems that span multiple disciplines. Co-creation of knowledge requires transdisciplinary approaches that can result in solutions that would not be possible with siloing. You will be collaborating with others who have different types of expertise, values, and terminology. Trust the expertise of others and actively seek feedback recognizing the importance of specialization.\nBe mindful and aware of your own biases: We all have biases that are inherent and can not be removed, but we can still work on both being less biased, and more aware of bias in ourselves and others. Periodically check in on your biases.\nPlan with intention, and follow through: Be organized and adaptable. Things don’t always go as planned and that’s OK. Planning can help you adapt when they don’t (see Come Prepared). Find a program/project management approach that works for you (see “How we work”); being organized can reduce stress immensely and help you progress with your goals.\nFoster inclusivity within our group and greater community: Part of our lab culture is that we are good citizens of our community, we take on leadership roles within SMAST and the University, we are supportive of others in our community during their milestones, we actively participate in SMAST events (e.g. the IMS graduate research symposium) and perform outreach. Work with Gavin when crafting your individual mentoring/development plans (see Chapter on Onboarding) to identify what you want to aim your efforts at.\nPromote and sustain healthy work-life integration: Our scientific research is not the only important thing in our lives, and publishing research is not the only mechanism by which to provide science and support our communities. We recognize the importance of our other commitments in keeping us healthy (mentally and physically) and bring our whole selves to our efforts. Try not to normalize overwork or being busy as achievement or status.\nPractice radical candor: We care personally while also challenging directly. Be honest when communicating, accept critical (but kind) feedback, and give the same to others. View relationships within the group as collaborative rather than evaluative. Don’t take constructive criticism personally.\nAcknowledge and give credit: Working as part of a team, we will often (always?) be building on work done by others, receive assistance with work (see “Ask for help”), and using others’ words, code, content. Include acknowledgement and give credit for those contributions, in all forms of communication. We share content and code within the group with this expectation. One easy approach is to include hyperlinks to the work of others or their social media in your work. This also helps to amplify their voice and work as well as yours.",

If you do not wish to contact Dr. Fay, please contact Department Chair Dr. Steve Cadrin scadrin@umassd.edu and/or SMAST Assistant Dean Mike Marino mmarino@umassd.edu. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.\nLab members who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the University of Massachusetts’ policies and/or the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ should seek assistance from a supervisor or an HR representative. Information about the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth’s Equal Opportunity and Anti-Harassment policies, complaint procedures and form.\nConfidentiality: Please remember that by way of his position at the university, Dr. Fay is a mandated reporter under Title IX. This means that he is not allowed to keep matters falling under Title IX confidential, and is required to disclose these incidents to the administration. You are welcome to discuss matters with Dr. Fay, but please keep this in mind when doing so. Gavin will do his best to remind you of his responsibilities at the start of conversations anticipated to relate to these topics. If you would prefer to discuss incidents of harassment that fall under Title IX with a confidential source, you can contact David Gomes, UMass Dartmouth Director of Diversity and Inclusion.\nThis code of conduct applies to Fay lab spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab or another member of the SMAST community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Fay lab members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Fay lab based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Fay lab spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Fay lab. The University Counseling Center provides a range of services to help students develop improved coping skills to address emotional, interpersonal and academic concerns.\nTo protect our team members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.\nThe above caveats noted, we will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse when possible. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Fay lab members or the general public.

Gavin’s office is room 228.\nEveryone in the lab is provided with desk space. Lab members sit either in the lab itself, or in the shared graduate student cubicle space and shared postdoc offices. Gavin encourages people to set up and work where is most comfortable. Graduate students should make use of their allocated space in the shared area but can do computational work in the lab area.\nLab meetings are held either in the lab, or in one of the SMAST-E conference rooms.\n\n\n7.5.2 Key card building & room access\nAccess to the SMAST building, and to individual lab spaces within the building is through your UMass Pass keycard. Typically, you will have access to the SMAST gate, SMAST East building, the lab space (room #245), classrooms, and if you are a grad student/postdoc you will have access to the relevant shared office space.\nThe necessary building access forms can be found on the SMAST Occupants page which need to be filled out and approved and signed by Gavin before submitting to Mike Marino and Eric Lyonnais.\n\n\n7.5.3 Parking and transportation:\nParking at either of the SMAST buildings is free and no parking pass is required. Parking on the main UMassD campus requires a digital parking pass. If you are staff this pass is free, there is a fee for students. Full details for campus parking policies and procedures are on the UMassD parking webpage. Note that there is limited short-term/temporary parking available on campus so you may feel it’s not necessary to obtain a campus parking pass.",

    "text": "8.1 Working hours\nGavin generally does not hold people to working a fixed schedule, or to be in the office for a certain schedule. As adults, we should all set the working schedule that is the right fit for us, and it is likely that what this ‘fit’ is will change over the course of the time you are in the lab. Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific hours that will need to be worked and you should work with your main collaborator to outline these.\nGavin generally does not work evenings or on weekends, and does not expect that people in the lab are available at these times. Lab members should also not expect others to be available during these times.\nGraduate students are generally funded on annual research assistantship (RA) stipends. The RA contracts state that this stipend is for 20 hrs of work per week during the academic year and 40 hrs per week during summer to support full time study in the academic program. Most usually, students on RAships are being paid from a research grant where the focus of the grant is the topic the student is working on for their thesis research, so there is overlap here. We believe that training to do the research is part of the job, so this would include courses and additional time to read/learn methods, software too. Some people find that counting ‘billable hours’ is productive for them as it helps them keep accountable to themselves. Others do not find this method useful. Regularly assess what works best for you.\nFull time is enough, and we do not expect team members to work nights and weekends, though do not enforce a particular working hours schedule because students should feel flexible enough to create a work schedule that works for them.

Look beyond those offered at SMAST to include elsewhere at UMassD, the UMass system, and also at other institutions (consider the value of a semester exchange). A list of classes that lab members have taken, and suggested course of study schedule for Fay lab grad students can be found in Chapter @ref(courses).\nWe schedule regular individual meetings with Gavin throughout the year. At a minimum during the semester these will take place every two weeks, although there may be times when more regular meetings are needed. Meetings are a chance for you to get focused time with Gavin to discuss and work on your research. Thus they are your time, not Gavin’s. Come with an agenda with a list of things that you want to accomplish and work on during that time.\nWe share our research at local, national, and international meetings, and publish our findings in the scientific literature. Gavin strives to provide financial support for grad students to attend at least one major conference per year. You should expect to give a presentation (a poster or a talk) on your work at these.\n\n8.6.1 Funding\nGavin does not typically accept students into the lab without being able to guarantee at least 2 years of full funding. Students are encouraged to seek and apply for extramural funding to support their work. This includes scholarships and fellowships to pay for salary, but also smaller grants for travel, workshop attendance, or research costs. There are many opportunities out there, particularly for students. Some resources are outlined in Chapter @ref(funding).",

The proposal also serves as a guiding document for your initial committee meeting(s). Scope and plans for the MS thesis research will be developed through your meetings with Gavin and with the project team (for students whose work is being funded by a research grant). Your thesis proposal should contain a literature review, identification of research questions, an overview of the methods that will be used, and description of expected results and relevance/significance of the research. Aim for the proposal to be about 8 pages of text. While not a formal requirement for the IMS program, a MS thesis proposal serves to clarify and outline expectations for the degree for both the student and the thesis committee, and serves as a blueprint for building out the thesis itself (indeed you may likely re-use some of the text later). Thesis proposals written by other lab members are good examples of how these documents can be structured.\nThesis Committee: Forming your thesis committee: Your MS thesis committee serves as your guidance team during your research, and should be viewed as colleagues and collaborators. While building your proposal, discuss with Gavin who should be on the committee. Three committee members is the usual size, though sometimes students will have a fourth member. Generally in our program a committee will be made up of your advisor (Gavin), an additional UMassD faculty member, and an external member (often an agency collaborator on the project, e.g. at NOAA NMFS). See the official university guidelines for more specifics [link here].\nMS Thesis: [guidance on thesis structure to come]\nRemember, not everything will go to plan and your interests and findings may change. Content of theis proposals is not set in stone and can always be revised with communication and collaboration with the committee.

Gavin encourages students to think about dissertation chapters as publishable units. In the disseration, these 4 chapters will be accompanied by a general Introduction, and a concluding Synthesis chapter that ties the work presented in the dissertation together under the overarching research theme and goals.\nMilestones\n\n12.2.1 Pre-proposal (or “Preposal”, copyright M. Winton)\nPhD students in the Fay lab prepare a pre-proposal during their first year to outline the overall goals and themes of the dissertation research topic, and identify the individual research chapter topic questions. The pre-proposal serves as a guiding document and conversation starter for your initial committee meeting. Scope and plans for the thesis research will be developed through your meetings with Gavin and with the project team (for students whose work is being funded by a research grant). Your pre-proposal should contain a literature review, identification of research questions and potential chapter units, an overview of the methods that will be used to address the research questions, proposed course of study (coursework, etc.), and relevance/significance of the research. Aim for the pre-proposal to be about 5 pages of text. A 2-page precis version is useful when initially talking with committee members. While not a formal requirement for the IMS program, a pre-proposal serves to clarify student interests and goals for the degree for both the student and the thesis committee, and serves as a blueprint for building out the preliminary work and the dissertation proposal (indeed you may likely re-use some of the text later).\n\n\n12.2.2 Dissertation Committee\nYour PhD thesis committee serves as your guidance team during your research, and should be viewed as colleagues and collaborators. There is a required minimum for interaction with the committee, but you should add to this. After you have formed the committee, it is advisable to hold a committee meeting at least once a year, but it is encouraged to continuingly interact with committee members.\nWhile building your pre-proposal, discuss with Gavin who should be on the committee. For PhD committees, four members is the usual size, though often students will have a fifth member. Generally in our program a committee will be made up of your advisor (Gavin), two additional UMassD faculty members, and 1-2 external members (e.g. agency collaborators on the project funding the research, e.g. collaborators at NOAA NMFS). Aim to hold your first committee meeting no later than during the 3rd semester of your program. See the official university guidelines for more specifics [link here].\n[something on what is expected at committee meetings, e.g. presentation]\n\n\n12.2.3 Comprehensive Exams\nAs detailed in the IMS policy, PhD students undertake a two-part comprehensive examination, a 2-day written exam, and a public presentation and defense of the proposal. The written exam is taken once students have completed their coursework requirements (say after the 4th or before/during the 5th semester). Questions on the written exam include both open and closed book sections and will cover coursework and questions related to your field and dissertation topics. The proposal defense is usually scheduled the semester following successful completion of the written exam. Full requirement details for the exams are in the IMS policy. The comprehensive exam will be planned in coordination with Gavin, and the written exam requires 1 month preparation time (1 month of full-time work). See guidance below. [Written exam format & guidance] [Proposal defense format & guidance]\n\n\n12.2.4 Dissertation Proposal\nA proposal describing the research that will comprise the dissertation is a required, formal part of the academic program. Proposals should describe the goals and themes of the research to be conducted, and its context within current state of knowledge. The proposal should outline the research questions that each chapter will address, and give a description of the methods that will be used in each. The proposal serves as a guiding document for the remainder of your program and is the document that you and your committee will use to agree on the scope of work to be completed to fulfill the degree requirements. Your thesis proposal should contain a literature review, identification of research questions, an overview of the methods that will be used for each of these, and description of expected results and relevance/significance of the research. Aim for the proposal to be about 15 pages of text. Detail of planning for each chapter will not be as comprehensive (it is expected that later chapters may not be as fleshed out), but the proposal should provide enough detail of what the student will do for the committee to evaluate whether the scope of work is sufficient (and likely make recommendations for reducing or refining this). It is common for students to have completed or be close to having completed work for at least one of the chapters by the time of defending the proposal.\nUltimately, the proposal serves to clarify and outline expectations for the degree for both the student and the thesis committee, and serves as a blueprint for building out the thesis itself (indeed you will re-use some of the text later).\nPhD Thesis: [guidance on thesis structure to come]\nRemember, not everything will go to plan and your interests and findings may change. Content of thesis proposals is not set in stone and can always be revised with communication and collaboration with the committee. View proposals and exams as items that help you build your scientific products rather than evaluative procedures that need to be checked off.",
